# Issue Tracker System
According to Wikipedia, issue tracker is a software application that keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects. Many bug tracking systems, such as those used by most open-source software projects, allow end-users to enter bug reports directly. Other systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are integrated with other project management software.

Many famous software development platforms such as GitHub have offered this feature. You may refer to that. However, this issue tracker system that you are going to program will have much more features than GitHub’s issue tracker.

In simple terms, an issue tracker system allows anyone to report a bug of the software project so that the software developer team is able to track it, discuss and resolve it in an organized way. Besides, issues can be recorded by priority, tags and timelines which makes it more organized and easier to track.
